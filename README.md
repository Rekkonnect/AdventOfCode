This repo contains my C# solutions for Advent of Code throughout all years.

## Disclaimer

I have not solved all problems, and that's why many days are missing. It's not that I don't want to share my code.

## Libraries

- **[Advent of C#](https://github.com/Rekkonnect/AdventOfCSharp)**: A library for solving AoC problems in a C# solution (should work for all .NET languages including VB and F#)
  - **[Template for Advent of C#](https://github.com/Rekkonnect/AdventOfCSharp.Template)**: A template for setting up your own AoC solutions in C#
- **[Garyon](https://github.com/Rekkonnect/Garyon)**: Helpful utilities and functions for generic operations

## Plans

### Opinions on problems

Having solved most of the problems, and looked at all of them, I've taken some time to rate the difficulty of solving each part in an Excel sheet. Once it's done, it will be linked here.

Additional metrics other than difficulty are in the plans too, like enjoyability, uniqueness, mathematicalness, etc.
